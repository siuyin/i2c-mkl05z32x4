Module "CI2C1"     (component I2C_LDD)
   - CI2C1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - CI2C1_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes inclusive 
                of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be 
                specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target slave 
                address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The 
                state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent are 
                not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_MasterGetBlockSentStatus -This method returns current state of MasterSendBlock method. This method is available only 
                for the MASTER mode and if method MasterSendBlock is enabled.
   - CI2C1_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_MasterGetBlockReceivedStatus -This method returns current state of MasterReceiveBlock method. This method is 
                available only for the MASTER mode and if method MasterReceiveBlock is enabled.
   - CI2C1_Main -This method is available only for polling mode. If interrupt service is disabled this method replaces the I2C 
                interrupt handler. This method should be called if Receive/SendBlock was invoked before in order to run the 
                reception/transmition.

Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO_LDD)
   - Bit1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
